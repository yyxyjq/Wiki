# Server Info

> **LAST UPDATE: {docsify-updated}**

Timory is composed of multiple sub-servers. This page will introduce you to the details of each server.

Each server has the different gameplay, equipment, backpacks and maps are independent, but chat is common.

Each server may have special rules, please refer to the special rules section in the server introduction below (if there is)。

Some sub-servers need whitelist , you may need to [Apply Whitelist](/en-US/join/whitelist.md).

-----

### Switch to sub-server

You can use the command: ``/server <ID>`` to switch between sub-servers.

?> Servers marked with 💠 are <span class="nw-explain" title="例如，服务器为 1.16.4 版本，则你只能使用 1.16.4 客户端"> **[independently operated servers ](#independent-server)** </span>  and cannot be switched using the ``/server`` command.

Server ID | Name | Enabled | Comments
---|---|---|---
[spawn](#spawn-server) | Spawn Server | :heavy_check_mark: | No whitelist required
[sc](#sclts-server) | Survival (Long-term support)  | :heavy_check_mark: | Long-term support
[cz](#cz-server) | Creative  | :heavy_check_mark: | Building
[event](#event-server) | Event  |  | 
[💠tech](#tech-server) | TechSurvival (Short-term support) |   | Full Vanilla Experience

[💠mod](#mod-server) | Mod Server |   | 

#### What is independent server？  :id=independent-server

Since some servers are updated frequently, some administrators are directly responsible for these servers and operate independently and are not included in the Timory Server network.

> The currently independently operated server is under the responsibility of the admin ``yyxyjq``.

Precautions: 
1. Independently operated servers also abide by the regulations of Timory.
2. No additional application is required for the whitelist.
3. At present, chat will not communicate with others sub-server.
