### Do I need to reapply for the whitelist after I changed my ID ?
- Minecraft accounts use a series of characters called UUIDs to represent users.
- The UUID of each user is different and cannot be modified after registration.
- Modifying the game ID does not modify the UUID, so the whitelist does not expire.
    - You can see [[here]](https://namemc.com/) to lookup your UUID.
